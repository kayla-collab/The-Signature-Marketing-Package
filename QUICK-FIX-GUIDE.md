## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

1. **You only need to do this ONCE**
   - After initialization, you never need to do it again
   - Unless you completely reset your database

2. **This creates your admin account**
   - Email: kayla@kaylasierra.com
   - Password: admin123
   - Change this password after first login!

3. **Must use published URL**
   - Won't work with local files
   - Must be the live, published version

---

## 🆘 TROUBLESHOOTING

### "I get a blank page"
- Make sure you're using the published URL
- Check that app is actually published
- Try hard refresh (Ctrl + Shift + R)

### "Button doesn't do anything"
- Open console (F12)
- Look for error messages
- Database tables might not exist

### "Still says invalid credentials"
- Did you see the success message?
- Are you using the exact email/password?
- Try clearing browser cache

### "Database already initialized message"
- This means admin user already exists
- Just go to login page
- Use: kayla@kaylasierra.com / admin123
