# ✅ Sidebar Cleaned Up

## What Was Removed

I've removed these items from ALL admin page sidebars:
- ❌ 🚀 Quick Creator (removed)
- ❌ 📦 Module Hub (removed)
- ❌ 🔧 Fix Modules (removed)

## Updated Files

1. ✅ `module-builder.html` - Clean sidebar

3. ✅ `client-modules.html` - Clean sidebar (back to original simple menu)
4. ✅ `file-upload.html` - Clean sidebar
5. ✅ `welcome-messages.html` - Clean sidebar

## Current Clean Menu Structure

### module-builder.html sidebar:
- Dashboard
- Manage Clients
- Manage Modules
- Module Builder (current)
- All Content
- Client Modules
- File Manager
- Logout

### admin.html sidebar:
- Manage Clients
- Client Modules
- Manage Modules
- Module Builder

### Other pages:
All back to their original, clean menus without the emoji clutter!

## Next Steps

**After you publish these changes:**
1. Hard refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. The ugly additions will be gone
3. Clean, simple menus restored

**Note:** The files themselves (fix-modules.html, module-hub.html, quick-module-creator.html) still exist, they're just not linked in the menus anymore. If you want, I can delete those files too.

**Status:** ✅ Sidebars cleaned and restored to original state!
